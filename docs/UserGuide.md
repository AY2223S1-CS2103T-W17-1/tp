# User Guide
Travelr is a desktop app for managing trips and events, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Travelr can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

## Features
**Notes about the command format:**
Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
e.g. in `add -t TITLE`, TITLE is a parameter which can be used as `add -t Switzerland Trip`.

Items in square brackets are optional.
e.g NAME [TAG] can be used as John Doe/Friend or as John Doe.

The ‘/’ character is used to separate parameters supplied by the user.
E.g. in `add -e TITLE DATE LOCATION DESCRIPTION`, ‘/’ is used to separate the four parameters supplied which can be used as `add -e Sightseeing/20-06-2030/Taiwan/Visit mountains`.

Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as bye) will be ignored.
e.g. if the command specifies `bye 123`, it will be interpreted as `bye`.
