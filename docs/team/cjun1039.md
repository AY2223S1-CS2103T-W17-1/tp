## Project: Travelr
Travelr allows you to plan trips around the activities in your bucket list. You will be able to keep track of your bucket list, travel dates, locations, and itineraries, all within the same app!

## Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view the summary of travels a User has completed.
  * What it does: allows the user to view all his completed trips and statistics related to his travel completion. Brings up a new window which shows the completed trips, percentage of trips and events completed, and unique locations visited.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can reflect on the percentage of their bucket list events they have actually completed. It also allows the user to celebrate his unique locations visited and number of trips completed, enhancing the satisfaction of clearing his bucket list.
  * Highlights: This enhancement forms a key component of the app's enjoyment, by allowing the user to be satisfied with his progress. It required major UI additions, including a new window to display the summary statistics and information. The implementation was semi-challenging as it required several changes to different components of the app, which included the addition of an observable SummaryVariable class which the GUI depends on.
