## Project: Travelr

Travelr allows you to plan trips around the activities in your bucket list. You will be able to keep track of your
bucket list, travel dates, locations, and itineraries, all within the same app!

## Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display an event.
    * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed
      by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and
      the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth
      analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing
      commands.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in
      the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
